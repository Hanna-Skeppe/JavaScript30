    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    // let name = "Hanna";
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2) //Hanna, Hanna
    // name = "Hedda";
    // console.log(name, name2); //Hedda, Hanna

    // changing the value of the original variable is not going to update the value of the other variable (the copy).

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // reference, not copy
    console.log(players, team) // same values

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team) // original array players changes also (mutates)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too! (mutated it)

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

     // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice does not mutate the original array. If you use slice and pass nothing, it will take a copy of the original array.
    team2[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(team2, players) // does not mutat original array
  
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // works the same way as slice();
    team3[3] = "Sasha";
    console.log(team3, players) // does not mutat original array

    // or use the ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // takes a copy and spreads it in to a new array. Works the same as slice() or concat above.
    team4[3] = "Billie";
    console.log(team4, team); // does not mutat original array

    // or you could use Array.from:
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Konny"
    console.log(team5, players) // does not mutat original array

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // reference, not copy...
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person) // ...mutates the original

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const coder = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 18 });
    console.log({coder})
    console.log({person})

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //OR the poor man's deep clone:
    const personClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    personClone.age = 22;
    console.log({ personClone })
    console.log({ person })

    //So if you have an object like this:
    const programmer = {
      name: 'Hanna',
      age: 41,
      social: {
        twitter: '@hannaskeppe',
        LinkedIn: 'linkedin.com/user/hannaskeppe'
      }
    }

    //And you would use Obect.assign:
    const dev = Object.assign({}, programmer)

    //it will not work as desired because...
    dev.social.twitter = '@hanna_skeppe'
    console.log(programmer.social, dev.social) // ...it mutates the object if under one level deep as in this case.
